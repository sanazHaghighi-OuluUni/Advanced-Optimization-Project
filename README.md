Inventory Optimization for Perishable Items
Advanced Operations Research Project | Ferdowsi University of Mashhad
Project Overview:
This project involves developing a new mathematical inventory model for perishable goods. Unlike basic models, this research incorporates inflation, time-and-price dependent demand functions, and backordering within a finite time horizon.

Key Features of the Model
Demand Function: A non-linear function dependent on both time and selling price.

Realistic Constraints: Inclusion of inflation rates and deterioration (decay) rates.

Mathematical Solution: Derived optimal ordering intervals using differential calculus to minimize total system costs.

Sensitivity Analysis: Validated the model by analyzing how changes in decay rates and price sensitivity affect the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).

Results
The model proved that as the deterioration rate increases, the optimal order quantity decreases—encouraging more frequent, smaller orders to minimize loss.

Tech Stack
Mathematics: Differential Calculus & Optimization.

Tools: Developed and tested through numerical examples (Industrial Case Study: Alvan Paint Factory).
